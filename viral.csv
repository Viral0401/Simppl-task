Florian Haas,"Serious question: why is it that so many people apparently have real problems adopting ISO 8601 dates and UTC, in a professional context?
As in, are those somehow fundamentally incompatible with human nature? Or do people just completely lack the cultural awareness to understand that some of their colleagues are used to a different date format than they are, or live in a different timezone, or don't use daylight saving time?

Stars form in cold, dusty clouds of mostly hydrogen gas. As they grow, stars pull in more mass from disks, permeated with magnetic fields. The fields twist around the star, channeling some gas into the star and some into jets above and below the disk.
