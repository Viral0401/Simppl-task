Radical Communal Care,"""Now let's fold this into some statements we've heard from Pfizer CEOs and investors over the last few years. During a 2022 earnings call, the company celebrated the drop of mask mandates. One of their presidents predicted that ""People are going to get out there... infections are going to increase...that's the role that Paxlovid can play."" Pfizer spent $25 million, not on research, but on lobbying Congress to protect their patents on vaccines and treatments. In 2021 alone, they doubled their revenue, bringing in more than $81 billion.Actual journalists attending the meeting were shocked at how Pfizer officials spoke in cheerful tones, directly acknowledging how the end of mask mandates and social distancing would increase infections. Even the company's chief science officer described the chronically ill and immunocompromised as ""a real new opportunity growth area for Paxlovid to do very well.""https://www.okdoomer.io/becomingwendigo/#Okdoomer #Greed #Capitalism"

'It's a weaponizing of #antisemitism for their own #political purposes, which is to #SuppressDissent. And if, in fact, as the governor and the college president said, the point is to make the campus safer for the Jewish community members, I have to say that what happened next made it decidedly less safe for all of us.'""Orleck, who has been a professor at Dartmouth for more than three decades, said as part of her bail condition, she is being banned from Dartmouth's campus.

BrianKrebs,"Basically all of the speaking requests I've received over the last six months, all any of them want to talk about is AI, b/c everyone is trying to position themselves as being the perfect partner to usher companies through the madness. I'm probably not going to be asked to do speaking much longer, b/c I find I am fairly hawkish on all the AI hype. I guess I come from a pretty old-fashioned point of view on technology vs security, which is basically that the more you complexify something, the harder it is to secure. And most of the AI visions that companies are espousing would increase the complexity of security efforts by several orders of magnitude. The issue of data governance is just one small microcosm of that (one in which most fail at miserably already).I think it's also safe to predict that first movers here (beyond the now entrenched big ones) are going to get clobbered by regulation soon."

MF Dume,"“While TikTok is a convenient scapegoat for lawmakers, the reality is that American public support for Israel’s continued assault on Gaza has waned considerably since the start of the war. In the face of widespread devastation in Gaza, impending famine, and the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians — many of them women and children — Americans increasingly feel that Israel’s response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack has been outsized and excessive. The sentiment has resulted in nationwide protests calling for the end of American military support for Israel, and no social media ban will make that go away.”https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/lawmakers-tiktok-ban-pro-palestinian-content-1235016101/"

Lauren Weinstein,"I'm going to back off a wee bit on my general criticism of #YouTube ""reaction videos"", at least as far as Hitchcock's masterpiece ""North by Northwest"" (1959) is concerned. The film blows away every reaction individual, pair, or group that I've come across watching it. In most cases, they've simply never seen a film like this before, and are staggered by it in pretty much every respect (including the fact that, of course, there's no CGI). But really everything about it impresses them, as it should. And they all are amazed at a complex plot and what is indeed a most remarkable transition at the very end, from hanging on a cliff to a berth on a train. Probably the only transition that beats it is the flying bone in ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""And you also can see some of them noting with disdain that so much of what they've seen during their lives was obviously just copying of themes that originated in films like North by Northwest, and now excited to see other films from back then.Which if nothing else, tells us how the film industry of recent decades has failed young people (yeah, and everyone else too) so dismally."

My current role is stressful, pays terribly, and with the possibility of losing it over the next couple of weeks, my anxiety is going through the roof. Thanks for any help you give. ❤️"
joey castillo,"Almost back to NYC after a successful Open Hardware Summit in Montreal! Truly delightful to see folks and connect, especially with friends and colleagues I&#39;d only met online til now. My one regret is I wish I’d had more energy; between table prep and the sprint to the end of semester, I fear I showed up exhausted and wasn’t as present as I could have been. It was everyone else’s presence that buoyed me, and the truly welcoming and inclusive vibe that OSHWA fosters. So happy to have taken part. ❤️"

abolitionmedia," Hamas informed mediators that it has agreed to a proposed prisoner exchange and ceasefire deal with the occupation, the movement’s Media Office announced on Monday.This was confirmed by a senior Palestinian Resistance official who said, “The mediators and Hamas reached a new, tight formula that would lead to a ceasefire, thus overcoming this dilemma.”“Hamas was extremely flexible in reaching an agreement, and the ball is now in the regime’s court,” the source explained.In its statement, the Resistance faction announced that the head of Hamas’ Political Bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, held a phone call with the Qatari Prime Minister, Mohammad bin Rahman al-Thani, and the Director of Egyptian Intelligence Minister Abbas Kamel, informing that the movement has agreed to “their proposal for a ceasefire.”The entity has yet to agree to the latest proposal.—–  The full text of the ceasefire and exchange proposal that Hamas agreed to today can be found below, published by Al-Akhbar and was translated by RNN.The proposal results in the release of all zionist prisoners in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire, the full withdrawal of the occupation from the Gaza Strip, reconstruction, and lifting the siege on the Gaza Strip.The resistance received guarantees from mediators that the term “sustainable calm” yields a permanent ceasefire. As this was the last remaining disagreement, in light of the resistance’s flexibility on the other four conditions, the proposal was approved.It is noteworthy that the zionist entity has not yet agreed to the proposal. Netanyahu’s office issued a statement that a zionist delegation will be sent to continue indirect negotiations despite that the proposal is “far from “israel’s” necessary requirements. Resistance sources confirmed that Hamas is sending a delegation to Cairo tomorrow as well.Full text of the ceasefire and exchange proposal that Hamas agreed to tonight:—Basic principles for an agreement between the “israeli” side and the Palestinian side in Gaza on the exchange of detainees and prisoners between the two parties and the return to sustainable calm.The framework agreement aims to release all “israeli” detainees in Gaza, both civilians and soldiers, whether alive or otherwise, from all periods and times in exchange for a number of prisoners in “israeli” prisons to be agreed upon, and the return to sustainable calm, achieving a permanent ceasefire, and the withdrawal of “israeli” forces from Gaza, and reconstruction.The framework agreement consists of 3 interconnected and interrelated phases, as follows:Phase One (42 days):  1- Temporary cessation of mutual military operations between the two parties, and withdrawal of “israeli” forces eastward and away from densely populated areas to an area along the border in all areas of the Gaza Strip including Wadi Gaza – (“Netzarim” axis and Kuwait roundabout) as shown below.2- Suspension of military and reconnaissance flights in the Gaza Strip for ten hours a day, and for 12 hours on the days of releasing detainees and prisoners.3- Return of displaced persons to their residential areas and withdrawal from Wadi Gaza (“Netzarim” axis and Kuwait roundabout):– On the third day (after releasing 3 detainees) the “israeli” forces completely withdraw from Rashid Street east to Salah Al-Din Street, dismantle military sites and installations in this area completely, and begin the return of displaced persons to their residential areas (without carrying weapons during their return), and freedom of movement for residents in all areas of the Strip, and entry of humanitarian aid from Rashid Street from day one without obstacles.– On day 22 (after releasing half of the living detainees including female soldiers) “israeli” forces withdraw from the central sector (especially the axes of “Netzarim,” Al-Shuhada, and Kuwait roundabout) east of Salah Al-Din Road to an area close to the border, dismantle all military sites and installations completely, and continue the return of displaced persons to their homes in the northern Strip, and freedom of movement for residents in all areas of the Strip.– From day one, intensive and sufficient quantities of humanitarian aid, relief materials, and fuel (600 trucks daily including 50 fuel trucks, 300 for the north) are introduced, including the fuel necessary to operate the power station, trade, and equipment needed to remove rubble, and rehabilitate and operate hospitals, health centers, and bakeries in all areas of the Gaza Strip, and continue this in all stages of the agreement.4- Exchange of detainees and prisoners between the two parties:– During the first phase, Hamas releases 33 “israeli” detainees (alive or bodies) of women (civilians and soldiers) and children (under 19 years of age non-soldiers) and the elderly (over 50 years old) and sick and wounded civilians, in exchange for a number of prisoners in “israeli” prisons and detention camps, as follows:– Hamas releases all living “israeli” civilian women and children (under 19 years of age non-soldiers), in return “israel” releases 30 children and women for each “israeli” released, based on lists provided by Hamas prioritized by earliest arrest.– Hamas releases all living elderly (over 50 years old) and sick and wounded “israeli” civilians, in return “israel” releases 30 prisoners of the elderly (over 50 years old) and sick in exchange for each “israeli” released, based on lists provided by Hamas prioritized by earliest arrest.– Hamas releases all living female “israeli” soldiers, in return “israel” releases 50 prisoners from its prisons for each “israeli” soldiers released (30 life sentences, 20 other sentences), based on lists provided by Hamas.5- Scheduling the exchange of detainees and prisoners between the parties in the first phase:– Hamas releases 3 “israeli” detainees on the third day of the agreement and then releases 3 more detainees every seven days starting with women where possible (civilians and soldiers). In the sixth week, Hamas releases all remaining civilian detainees included in this phase, in return “israel” releases the agreed number of Palestinian prisoners from “israeli” prisons, according to the lists that will be provided by Hamas.– By the seventh day (where possible) Hamas will provide information on the number of living “israeli” detainees to be released in this phase.– On day 22, the “israeli” side releases all prisoners of the Shalit deal who were re-arrested.– If the number of living “israeli” detainees intended for release does not reach 33, the number will be completed from the bodies from the same categories for this phase, in return, “israel” releases all those arrested from Gaza Strip after October 7, 2023, of women and children (under 19 years old) to be done in the fifth week of this phase.– The exchange process is linked to compliance with the terms of the agreement, including stopping mutual military operations, withdrawal of forces, return of displaced persons, and entry of humanitarian aid.6- Completing the legal procedures necessary to ensure that released Palestinian prisoners are not arrested based on the same charges they were previously arrested for.7- The milestones of the first phase outlined above do not form the basis for negotiating the milestones of the second phase. 8- Lifting measures and penalties that were taken against prisoners and detainees in “israeli” prisons and detention camps after October 7, 2023, and improving their conditions, including those arrested after this date.9- By no later than day 16 of the first phase, indirect negotiations between the parties begin regarding the details of the second phase of this agreement concerning the keys to exchanging prisoners and detainees from both parties (soldiers and remaining men), to be completed and agreed upon before the end of the fifth week of this phase.10- The United Nations and its agencies, including UNRWA and other international organizations, continue their work in providing humanitarian services in all areas of the Gaza Strip, and this continues in all stages of the agreement.11- Starting the rehabilitation of infrastructure (electricity, water, sewage, communications, and roads) in all areas of the Gaza Strip, and introducing necessary civil defense equipment, removing rubble and debris, and this continues in all stages of the agreement.12- Facilitating the introduction of supplies and requirements necessary to accommodate and house displaced persons who lost their homes during the war (at least 60,000 temporary houses – caravans – and 200,000 tents).13- From day one of this phase, a agreed number (no less than 50) of wounded military personnel are allowed to travel through the Rafah crossing for medical treatment, increasing the number of sick and wounded through the Rafah crossing and lifting restrictions on travelers and the return of goods and trade without restrictions.14- Starting the arrangements and plans necessary for the comprehensive reconstruction process of houses, civilian facilities, and civil infrastructure that were destroyed due to the war and compensating the affected under the supervision of several countries and organizations including Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations.15- All measures in this phase including the temporary cessation of mutual military operations, relief and shelter, withdrawal of forces, etc., shall continue in the second phase until the announcement of sustainable calm (cessation of military and hostile operations).Phase Two (42 days):Announcement of the return to sustainable calm (cessation of military and hostile operations) and its implementation before starting the exchange of detainees and prisoners between the parties – all remaining “israeli” men in Gaza (civilians and soldiers) – in exchange for a number agreed upon of prisoners in “israeli” prisons and detainees in “israeli” detention camps, and complete withdrawal of “israeli” forces from Gaza Strip.Phase Three (42 days): 1- Exchange of bodies and remains of the deceased on both sides after locating and identifying them.2- Start implementing a plan to reconstruct the Gaza Strip for a period of 3 to 5 years including houses, civilian facilities, and infrastructure, and compensating all affected under the supervision of several countries and organizations including Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations.3- Ending the complete siege on the Gaza Strip.Guarantors of the agreement:Qatar, Egypt, the United States, and the United NationsMay 5, 2024 https://abolitionmedia.noblogs.org/post/2024/05/07/palestinian-resistance-accepts-ceasefire-framework-full-text/#alAqsaMartyrs #axisOfResistance #ceasefire #gaza #hamas #negotiations #palestine #pflp #pij #westAsia"

搜狐新闻（镜像）,【独家|  #网约车司机自述  ：每月挣1.5万才能养家 曾连续5天睡车里】李师傅是北京一名网约车司机，他认为这行不是谁都能赚到钱的，越来越难挣到钱已成网约车行业共识。“要聪明地开车”，李师傅认为这很重要，“聪明”是需要理解规则，遵循并加以利用，体力和时间的消耗只是基础。李师傅给自己制定的目标是一天流水高于800元才能休息，一日开销不能超过100元。为此他摸索出了自己的接单方法论，找到了最划算的午餐团购券，蹭过滴滴公司的食堂早餐，曾连续五天住在车里，后备箱里每天都载着脸盆、毛巾、牙刷和批发来的5块钱洗头膏。他说，住在车里有时是不可避免的，看到“臭车”的热搜，自己洗车更勤快了。以下是李师傅的自述：我对一日三餐的开销有严格的要求，否则北京赚钱北京花，一个子儿都带不回家。我有两个儿子，一个刚上一年级，一个正在上大二，每个月我会给在老家的妻子打8000元，给大二的儿子2000元的生活费，所以我要保证一个月到手13000元到15000元。自己的开销要限制额度，三餐不超过30元、日开销不超过100元，日收入也要设置下限，不开到800元的流水不收车。每天我都错峰吃饭，中午一点之后人少了、单子也少了。吃饭要在15分钟内搞定，我们常去北京南站，把车停远一点，从地下穿过去对面就有个南城香。在路边靠边停车，从停车开始算要超过15分钟才罚款，我会赶在罚款前赶紧吃完。在东三环国贸附近不好停车的地方，就把后备箱或者前机顶盖掀开，假装车有故障，上厕所时间也是一样，都要快。晚餐一般不吃，保持饥饿感才不会犯困，开夜车的司机都不爱吃晚餐。如果饿了我就吃个小面包垫垫。实在饿得不行了，我就去便利蜂泡个面垫巴垫巴，这样也不容易长小肚子，不然吃饱了撑得肚子老疼了，还往车里一坐好几个小时，容易胃痉挛。前一天夜里充的电没办法撑到第二天的11点之后，试验了几次后我发现中午充半小时电是最划算的选择，所以我会在下午1点到5点之间我会选一个时间段眯一会儿，但一定不能超过半小时。眯半小时、同步充电半小时，能让我和车共同运转到凌晨2点。一天充电只花70元，能够为我换来800元以上的流水，减少空驶率是关键，而我能做的就是多个平台换着开。我后备箱里一直拉着一个洗脸盆，牙刷牙膏洗头膏毛巾换洗衣物都在里面，还特地在闲鱼上找人帮我换了可以放平的车座椅，做好随时有可能要住在车里的准备。司机住车里的不占少数，其实还是单子太少了。今年元宵节后我明显感觉网约车变多了，我经常跑相同的路、相同的区，同样的时间里近期单量少了特别多。一般情况下，到了凌晨一两点才能干够800元的流水，这个时长熬不出来真不行。我曾经连着五天睡在车里，因为跑偏了，单子接着接着就离家太远，如果晚上放空回去，睡三四个小时又要起床出车也不划算。不如留在“热区”里，第二天早上醒了直接开工。车子边充电我边睡觉，有的充电区只能免费停车俩小时，我就定个两个小时的闹钟，开出去再开进来睡觉。充电桩附近如果有热水，早上起来我就在那洗头刷牙，连带着把身上的衣服也洗了，再拉回家晒。住在外面才会发现，洗澡其实挺方便的。如果在五环外找大众澡堂洗澡一次才十几元，而且五环外地方偏僻停车乱停也没有人会罚款。进了城就贵了，到了三四环内要20多元。  #洞见计划  更多详细内容请查看原文&gt;&gt;  :sys_link: 网页链接 https://3g.k.sohu.com/t/n788510726 :icon_weibo: https://weibo.com/5890672121/OdamyhgHW#搜狐新闻

So everyone uses it for all the things. But without a lot of care the result feels cheap. And then we suddenly realize that it produces huge amounts of waste. And uses a lot of finite resources. And once it’s there it doesn’t go away. And then we find that microplastics somehow got into everything and we have no idea how to get it out again.

██████,【解説】 ハマスの「提案受け入れ」、ネタニヤフ氏にとって想定外　厳しい選択迫る - BBCニュースhttps://www.bbc.com/japanese/articles/c19d2veywmpo”ネタニヤフ氏は政治的窮地に置かれている。イスラエルの連立政権は、ユダヤ系の極度のナショナリストらの支持に依存している。それらの人々は、ラファの完全なる占拠を求めており、それが実現しないなら政権を倒すと脅している。停戦はラファ攻撃の中止を意味する。一方で、イスラエル人の人質の家族や支援者らは、人質を取り戻すために取引に応じるよう政府に求めている。主要道路を封鎖するなどし、デモを繰り広げている。アメリカも取引を望んでいる。ジョー・バイデン大統領は、イスラエル軍が多大な人数のパレスチナ住民を殺害している中でもイスラエルを支持し続けているが、秋の大統領選挙を前に、政治的支持を失うリスクに直面している。ハマスはネタニヤフ氏に圧力をかけている。もしバイデン氏がネタニヤフ氏に対し、停戦を受け入れるよう迫れば、ネタニヤフ氏は自らの政権の存続を選ぶか、昨年10月7日のハマスの襲撃以来受けてきた重要なアメリカの支持を選ぶか、決断しなくてはならなくなる。”

Esto debido a que los cachorros hacían apariciones en cámara no planificadas de vez en cuando. Todavía se pueden ver esas invasiones sorpresa de perros en los primeros capítulos del programa.Tipicamente rodeado de varios perros, Curly, era conocido por llegar a su casa llevando algún perrito en condición de calle y albergarlo hasta poder encontrarle un hogar.  Cuando los Chiflados estaban de Tour, Curly, se encargó estrictamente de conseguirle un nuevo hogar al menos a un perro en condición de calle en cada pueblo que visitaran. Se estima que Curly, salvó y rescató más de 5000 perros durante su vida. Esto lo hace un hombre adelantado a su tiempo. Un hombre que merece ser recordado como uno de los primeros rescatistas."
